## 🎨 UI Components

```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- ✅ Admin check via Clerk's `publicMetadata`
- ✅ UI elements conditionally rendered based on role
- ✅ No admin controls visible to regular users
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for destructive actions

### Current Limitations

⚠️ **Note:** Video URLs are currently stored in browser localStorage

**What this means:**

- ✅ Fast and simple implementation
- ✅ No backend database required initially
- ❌ URLs only persist in the same browser
- ❌ Not synced across devices or users
- ❌ Clearing browser data resets to default

**Recommendation:** For production, implement a database (see Future Enhancements)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Admin Role Check

```typescript
// Check user's role from Clerk metadata
const userRole = user.publicMetadata?.role as string | undefined;
const isAdmin = userRole === "admin";
```

### URL Format Conversion

```typescript
// Converts various YouTube URL formats to embed format
if (newVideoUrl.includes("youtube.com/watch?v=")) {
  const videoId = newVideoUrl.split("v=")[1]?.split("&")[0];
  embedUrl = `https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}`;
}
```

### Local Storage Persistence

```typescript
// Save video URL
localStorage.setItem("videoUrl", embedUrl);

// Load video URL on mount
const savedUrl = localStorage.getItem("videoUrl");
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Mobile

- Buttons stack vertically
- Full-width video player
- Touch-friendly controls
- Reduced padding

### Desktop

- Buttons side-by-side

- Previous values
- Change reason/notes

### 5. Advanced Permissions

**More granular roles:**

- Super Admin (full access)
- Content Editor (video only)
- Moderator (limited editing)
- Viewer (read-only)

### 6. Media Validation

**Enhanced security:**

- Validate YouTube URLs
- Check video availability
- Preview before saving
- Thumbnail generation

### 7. Version Control
